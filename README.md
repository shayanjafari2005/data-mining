This is a data mining project for predicting weather conditions.
# Weather Condition Prediction Project  

This project is a data mining initiative designed to predict weather conditions. Our goal is to use machine learning algorithms and historical weather data to forecast atmospheric conditions in the near future.  

## Project Overview  

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Data:** Historical weather data from [[data source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taghizadeh598/Image_processing/main/weather.csv)] 

## Getting Started  

1. **Install Dependencies:** First, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:  
    ```bash  
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
    ```  

2. **Run the Project:** You can execute the `weather_prediction.py` script to make predictions:  
    ```bash  
    python weather_prediction.py  
    ```  

## Results  

This project presents the results graphically and evaluates the accuracy of the predictions. All outputs are stored in the `output` folder.
